          openWMail wasn't created by a company, nor does it have a team that works on it 24/7, it was created by a passionate individual, and then forked and continued by the open source community! You can help make openWMail even better by contributing, even just once!

            <p>
              If you have a spare few minutes why not take a look at the open isues on GitHub? Maybe you can help another user, confirm that a bug exists or test that a bug works in different environments. (e.g. on a different Operating System). Helping to provide more information about bugs makes them easier to resolve
